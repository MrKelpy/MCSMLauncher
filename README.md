# This repository and project have been discontinued and passed over to Glowberry!
Glowberry's Launcher does exactly the same as MCSM but under a new name, with better code and still maintained by me. This decision was made for the sake of expansion and maintainability. [You can check it out here!](https://github.com/Glowberry-Servers/Glowberry-Launcher)

# MCSMLauncher
A program able to create fully customisable minecraft servers in a quick and easy way, all from an interactive launcher.  
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/MrKelpy/MCSMLauncher/wiki) for more information.
